Fractures can occur in seniors also due to osteoporosis (thinning and weakening of bone). The goal with fracture management is to provide a safe position for the bone to heal (typically around 8 weeks), while maintaining range of motion. As the bone heals, strengthening can begin and rehabilitation back to normal activities is progressed. At times surgery may be needed to hold the bone together with plates or screws. This stabilizes the bone, but does disrupt muscles and leads to more weakness in the shoulder muscles. Physical therapy is very much needed after this to restore normal range of motion and strength to the shoulder.

A bursa is a fluid filled sac that sits between muscles or tissues to cushion and reduce friction. In the shoulder there is a rather large bursa between the deltoid muscle and joint. This is called the sub-deltoid bursa. This bursa can often become inflamed due to abnormal joint movements, poor posture and weakness of the surrounding musculature. This causes strain to the tissues and excessive friction on the bursa. People tend to feel pain with movement and especially movement out to the side or reaching behind them. Tendons connect muscles to bones. In the shoulder common areas for tendonitis are in the rotator cuff tendons (supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor and subscapularis) and bicep tendons. Pain can be felt deep in the shoulder or in the front of the shoulder. Pain is usually felt as a sharp, catching sensation with certain movements." data-original-title="Bursitis / Tendonitis" title="Bursitis / Tendonitis">Bursitis / Tendonitis</li>

In advanced stages, bony spurs can form around the joint and even change the shape of the joint. Most minor to moderate cases of hip osteoarthritis can highly benefit from physical therapy.

This is due to a stretching out of the ligaments that hold the bones together or possibly a fracture. With poor posture and weakened abdominals as well as spinal muscles, the increase in the angle of the spine becomes too much over time and misalignment of the bones occurs. Symptoms can be mild such as general fatigue to the low back, achy pain or severe symptoms if there is compression on the nerves exciting the spine or spinal cord.

As we age, with declining activity or after an injury, walking can become difficult. With pain in the knee or hip, our walking pattern can change, leaving us with a limp and possibly back pain. Changes in posture can also be responsible for changes in walking patterns. When walking patterns change, abnormal stresses and strains with everyday activities can be transmitted to areas it shouldn’t.
